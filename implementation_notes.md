## Content handoff

The current `public/data/team-data.json` intentionally contains sample and
provisional content. Before launch, a team maintainer should follow
`docs/content-guide.md`, remove or replace `site.sampleNotice`, finalize the
upcoming hosted-event details, and confirm public roster and photo consent.
