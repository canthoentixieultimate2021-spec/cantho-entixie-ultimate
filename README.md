# CanTho Entixie Ultimate

A bilingual, data-driven landing page for CanTho Entixie Ultimate, a local
Ultimate Frisbee team in Can Tho, Vietnam.

The site is intentionally static in v1. It presents the team publicly and lets
volunteers maintain section content, including the upcoming hosted event,
schedule, roster, results, recent events, recruitment, and contact copy
through one documented JSON file. It does not contain a private admin
dashboard or a backend.

## Local development

Install dependencies and start the Angular development server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:4200/`. The app reloads when source or data files change.

## Content updates

Edit [`public/data/team-data.json`](public/data/team-data.json) for public
content. The field rules and copy/paste examples are in
[`docs/content-guide.md`](docs/content-guide.md).

For a safe update:

1. Edit only the relevant data record.
2. Keep Vietnamese and English values in their matching `vi` and `en` fields.
3. Check names, dates, scores, map links, and photo consent.
4. Open a pull request when possible.
5. Confirm the build passes before publishing.

## Build and test

```bash
npm run build
npx ng build --base-href /CEULandingPage/
npm test -- --watch=false
npx ng test --watch=false --include src/app/app.spec.ts
```

The production build is emitted to `dist/ceu-landing-page/browser`. Use
`npx ng build --base-href /CEULandingPage/` to reproduce the GitHub Pages base
path locally; the workflow itself runs
`npm run build -- --base-href "/CEULandingPage/"`.

## Architecture

The root `App` component only coordinates the data request, loading/error
state, and active language. Page sections are standalone components under
`src/app/components/`:

- `site-header`
- `hero`
- `about`
- `jersey-gallery`
- `schedule`
- `roster`
- `results`
- `upcoming-event`
- `recent-events`
- `recruitment`
- `site-footer`

`src/app/shared/localized-text.pipe.ts` handles bilingual text selection, while
`src/app/shared/content-labels.ts` owns shared schedule/result labels. The
editable content contract remains in `src/app/models/team-data.ts` and is loaded
by `src/app/services/team-data.service.ts`. That contract now includes a
dedicated `upcomingEvent` group for the hosted-tournament block placed before
the past-events gallery. Fixed brand imagery, including the three jersey
images, is centralized in `src/app/shared/brand-assets.ts`. Event photos and
opponent logos are maintained in `public/ceu-img/events/` and referenced by
the `events` data collection.

## Codebase reference

The evidence-backed repository map, architecture notes, conventions,
integration inventory, testing patterns, and maintenance concerns are in
[`docs/codebase/`](docs/codebase/). Keep those documents aligned with source
and configuration changes that affect future contributors or coding agents.

## Deployment

The workflow in [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
builds pull requests and deploys pushes to `main` through GitHub Pages. The
current repository path is configured as `/CEULandingPage/`; update the
`--base-href` value if the repository name or custom domain changes.

In the repository settings, set **Pages > Build and deployment > Source** to
**GitHub Actions**. The site should be published at the repository's GitHub
Pages URL after the first successful deployment.
